          <h2>Story</h2>
          <p>We met during our senior year at NU through a mutual friend. As hungry and frugal college students, a group of us met at Bar Louie for $1 burger Tuesdays. We quickly hit it off and made plans to hang out again.<p>
          <p>From there, we got to know each other through longboarding around campus, demolishing an entire tub of coffee ice cream in one sitting, sharing music playlists, and hanging out at the Lakefill. Our first “official” date was at Lincoln Park Zoo on a cold winter day-- we even ended up walking all the way downtown (and back...) but enjoyed each other’s company the whole time as we laughed and chatted.</p>
          <p>After graduation, we were in a long-distance relationship for 3 (!) years as Steph was in Chicago and Mat was in Madison, WI. Mat later moved back to Chicago and, in Oct 2016, proposed to Steph by Navy Pier. Throughout the 6 years of our relationship, we’ve been blessed with meeting each other’s families and old and new friends. We are so thankful and excited to celebrate our wedding with you all!</p>
