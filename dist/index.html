          <h2>Story</h2>
          <p>Steph and Mat met during their senior year at Northwestern through a mutual friend. They were invited to an outing at Bar Louie for $1 burger Tuesdays and quickly hit it off<p>
          <p>From there, they got to know each other through longboarding around campus, sharing music playlists, and hanging out at the Lakefill. They both agree the moment things “clicked” was when they decided to pick up a 1.5 qt of coffee ice cream… and then promptly demolish the entire tub in one sitting. They were both surprised and impressed with each other’s commitment to the challenge (but as most of you already know, they just really like ice cream).</p>
          <p>Later, they each agreed to plan a date night as their “official” first dates. Mat brought Steph to Lincoln Park Zoo, where they spent the afternoon visiting different exhibits. Then they ended up walking all the way downtown (and back...) but enjoyed each other’s company the whole time. Steph took Mat to the Chicago Cultural Center, but they got lost along the way. Since they didn’t have smartphones back then, she had drawn a map by hand and may or may not have marked down the correct intersection. They found it eventually and spent the rest of the day wandering around Millenium Park and Grant Park.</p>
          <p>After graduation, they were in a long-distance relationship for 3 (!) years as Steph was in Chicago, IL and Mat was in Madison, WI. Mat later moved back to Chicago and, in Oct 2016, proposed to Steph by Navy Pier. Throughout the 6 years of their relationship, they’ve been blessed with meeting each other’s families along with old and new friends. They’re so thankful and excited to have you all celebrate their wedding with them!</p>
